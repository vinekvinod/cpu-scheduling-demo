 CPU Scheduling Algorithms – Group Project
This repository demonstrates CPU Scheduling Algorithms using multiple approaches: Python and Web (HTML + JavaScript).

 About Scheduling Algorithms
FCFS (First Come First Serve) → Non-preemptive, runs processes in arrival order.  
SJF (Shortest Job First) → Selects the process with the smallest burst time.  
Round Robin → Preemptive scheduling with fixed time quantum.  
General formulas (for all):
Start Time= max(Current Time, Arrival Time)  
Completion Time = Start Time + Burst Time  
Waiting Time = Start Time – Arrival Time  
Turnaround Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time

Contributors & Work

 Aloshy Antony – `roundrobin.py`
- Implemented in Python.  
- Supports time quantum for preemptive scheduling.  
- Calculates waiting & turnaround times.  
- Prints Gantt chart representation of process execution.  

 Anto Boban – `fcfs.html`
- Implemented in HTML + JavaScript.  
- Web-based FCFS scheduling simulation.  
- Displays process results in a browser table.  

Vinek Vinod – `sjf.html`
- Implemented in HTML + JavaScript.  
- Web-based **Shortest Job First** scheduling.  
- Provides tabular output and scheduling order.  

 Run Instructions

 Aloshy’s Round Robin (Python)
```bash
python roundrobin.py


Together, we cover scheduling from basic console programs to interactive web apps and professional visualizations.
